After previously leaving the company, I rejoined the team as a backend developer<br>
to fill the gap left by the departure of the previous backend developer.

Despite being a backend developer, I also took on the role of maintaining the mobile app<br>
and onboarding new frontend developers,
essentially working as a full-stack engineer.
