On a web store built with Shopify, I did various customizations using vanilla JS and Liquid templates.<br>
I also created various custom components with Svelte to add dynamic functionalities.

Moreover, to create pages for receiving questionnaires and displaying the reports,<br>
I utilized the Vilay framework, which I created as a side project to utilize React and Relay in SSR.

Most of the development was done by collaborating with my teammates,<br>
and I also participated as a lead to help junior developers.
