  - Participated in the development of app and server for a new business targeting creator business.

The app was initially developed targeting mobile devices using Capacitor,<br>
and during this process, to improve UX, I ported [Stackflow](https://github.com/daangn/stackflow),<br>
a stack navigation library, [to Solid](https://github.com/daangn/stackflow/pull/473) and utilized it.

Later, the main target was changed to web,<br>
and to provide good UX in desktop environments while maximizing the use of existing code,<br>
I developed and utilized a plugin called [stackflow-plugin-omniflow](https://github.com/contentstech-com/stackflow-plugin-omniflow).

Additionally, I participated in GraphQL API server development using Rust,<br>
and to improve frontend DX through the use of Semantic Nullability,<br>
I developed a [support package](https://github.com/contentstech-com/async-graphql-semantic-nullability) for async-graphql and utilized it.
