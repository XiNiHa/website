  - Rewrote a B2B product from Angular 2 to Nuxt 2.
---

I worked on a B2B product for hospitals that includes a desktop Web UI for doctors and a mobile Web app for patients.<br>
The app provided end-to-end features like scheduling appointments, writing reports, scheduling blood tests,<br>
receiving questionnaires, displaying reports, sending dosage reminders, etc.

To perform SSR smoothly, optimization techniques like prefetching were applied.

Also, I worked on the API backend a little bit, written in Python and Falcon. I mostly fixed bugs and added some minor features.
