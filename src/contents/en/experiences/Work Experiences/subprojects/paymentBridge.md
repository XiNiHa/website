Payment Bridge is a custom checkout UI that replaces the default checkout UI provided by payment gateways.

To prevent customers from refusing to purchase due to poor experience,<br>
it is built with SolidStart to provide the best performance and UX.

By utilizing features like streaming SSR and server RPC, it was possible to provide<br>
a smooth checkout experience that handles about 300,000 requests per month.
