I contributed to several parts of the product like creating custom chart components with SVG and Framer Motion,<br>
and integrating `@defer` support for Relay to utilize concurrent features of React 18.

The chart components are made to match with high-quality standards that our team requires,<br>
focused on features like responsive design, animated transitions, and sticky axis labels.
