  - Created a mobile app that provides a health management solution based on blood test results.

The app provided personalized meal plans and supplements recommendations by analyzing the blood test results<br>
that are retrieved using APIs provided by the National Health Insurance Service of Korea.

I almost have worked on the app solely except for some infrastructure work,<br>
released the app to the Play Store, downloaded more than 1000 times.
