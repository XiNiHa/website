  - This is an Atomic CSS library similar to Tailwind CSS, but it works on an on-demand basis.

UnoCSS provides various features through multiple presets.<br>
Among them, the Attributify preset allows you to specify Atomic CSS classes as if they were regular properties,<br>
and it further offers a feature called Valueless Attributify, which applies styles when the attribute name is written directly on the tag.<br>

However, an issue was reported that this feature does not work in SolidJS [(#878)](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/issues/878).<br>
To resolve this issue, I added an option that makes slight modifications to the CSS generated by UnoCSS to ensure compatibility with SolidJS. [(#899)](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/pull/899)
