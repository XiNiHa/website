  - async-graphql is a server-side GraphQL framework for Rust.

async-graphql generally works with other backend frameworks,<br>
providing integration packages for popular backend frameworks.<br>
Among these, the integration package for the Rocket framework did not support the latest RC Release,<br>
so I added support for it. [(#545)](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql/pull/545)
