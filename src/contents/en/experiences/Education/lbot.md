The curriculum, centered around reading and analyzing social issues to establish values and self-directed learning, provided ample time for self-development, greatly contributing to my growth both personally and as a programmer.

Additionally, I organized small coding study groups to teach basic coding to students,<br>
acted as a teaching assistant in official coding classes to help students who were falling behind,<br>
and gained valuable experience in coding education.<br>
This has proven to be significantly helpful in communicating development-related matters with non-developers.

Since non-accredited alternative schools are not officially recognized as middle or high schools,<br>
I obtained my academic qualifications for both levels through the GED exams.
