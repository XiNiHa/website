When the League of Legends board was newly established on Ruliweb, the various utilities (item DB, strategy system, etc.)<br>
used in the existing community (LoL Inven) were very lacking, and this project was developed to address that issue.

I integrated Riot Games' League of Legends API and implemented a system for uploading strategies using Firebase.
