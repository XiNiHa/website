Created while learning Dart, Flutter, and Android development, this project was instrumental in learning how to compose UIs using various widgets.

Implemented matching API using Firebase Functions, integrated Google Maps to display the current location of each carpool member,<br>
and integrated Stripe for carpool fare payments.

The app was not put into actual operation due to legal issues related to Stripe integration (foreign nationals).
