It supports Suspense-based Streaming SSR with React 18 and Relay,<br>
and is configured to support Render-as-you-fetch by specifying GraphQL queries per page.

While looking for a suitable SSR framework to use in production at my company,<br>
I couldn't find an optimal framework for use with Relay, so I decided to create one myself.<br>
It is currently being used in the development of new products at my company.

It works well in edge runtime environments such as Cloudflare Workers,<br>
and advanced SSR techniques like Selective Hydration are planned to be applied in the future.

Although I previously received inquiries and open source contributions related to collaboration and usage from various channels,<br>
the framework has now been archived as we are no longer working on projects that use it.
