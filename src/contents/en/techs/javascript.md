I love JavaScript because it's a language
that can be used anywhere very conveniently,<br>
and its features inspired by functional programming
makes it way easier to write clean code.

Furthermore, it's a language that is keep evolving by the community,<br>
with a growing number of high quality packages
powered by one of the largest package ecosystems.
