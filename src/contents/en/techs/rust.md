I mainly use Rust for servers, native modules, and CLI tools,<br>
and can apply it freely in most scenarios<br>
except for unsafe code and highly advanced async patterns.<br>
I design interfaces with Rust's type system,<br>
including traits and enums, in the right contexts,<br>
and I sometimes build macros tailored to the situation<br>
to improve developer experience and productivity.
