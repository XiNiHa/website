I love Rust because it's a safe and fast language,<br>
based on its unique features like ownership and lifetimes.

Also, its powerful type system constructed with great features like traits and enums<br>
makes the language very attractive.

In addition, the macro system that is powerful and flexible<br>
is also a wonderful feature that only few languages have.
