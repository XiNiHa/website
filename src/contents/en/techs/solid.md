I have a deep, source-level understanding of SolidJS,<br>
its surrounding ecosystem, and its foundational tooling.<br>
Across the full lifecycle of SolidJS-based projects,<br>
I can contribute to problem-solving in many areas,<br>
including performance improvements, debugging, and tooling enhancements.<br>
I also run the [Solid Korea](https://discord.solid-korea.org) community<br>
and work to expand the SolidJS ecosystem.
